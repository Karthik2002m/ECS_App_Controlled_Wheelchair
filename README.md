# ECS_App_Controlled_Wheelchair
We have made a prototype of App Controlled Wheelchair which will help immensely in the medical sector and specially for those patients who are paraplegic
The Wheel-Chair moves in all 4 directions , just by pressing the direction button on the app. The app and wheel-chair are connected via Bluetooth. In case of any
emergency we have added a stop button. This immediately stops the movement of the wheel-chair.
